Sicky bit 
:  A bit that is set when an overflow occurs in an arithmetic operation.
Structural hazard 
:  A structural hazard occurs when two instructions require the same resource.
Round 
:  A round is a single iteration of the algorithm.
Data hazard 
:  A data hazard occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction in a way that is exposed by the instruction set architecture.
Pipeline data hazard 
:  A pipeline data hazard occurs when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction in a way that is exposed by the pipeline.
Pipelining 
:  Pipelining is an implementation technique in which multiple instructions are overlapped in execution.
Guard
:  A guard is a boolean expression that must be true for the instruction to execute.
Control signal 
Data signal 
:  A control signal is a signal that is asserted by a control unit to cause a particular action in the execution of an instruction.
Scientific notation 
:  A method of writing numbers as the product of a mantissa and a power of two.
Normalized number 
:  A normalized number is a number in which the mantissa is between 1 and 2.
Floating points 
:  A floating point is a number that can be represented in scientific notation.
Double precision 
:  Double precision is a floating point format that uses 64 bits.
Single precision
:  Single precision is a floating point format that uses 32 bits.
Half precision
:  Half precision is a floating point format that uses 16 bits.
